What is Big Data

Big data is a term for:
• Massive data sets, with varied and complex structure
• With the difficulties of storing and analysing
• Visualizing for further processes or results.

Building a Data Lake from Scratch in Amazon S3
• Joining Semi-Structured and Structured Data:
• A data lake in Amazon S3 can store vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Joining these different types of data allows for comprehensive analytics and insights.

Lake House Architecture Design
Best Practices for Cost and Performance:
• Data Partitioning: Organize data in partitions to improve query performance and reduce costs.
• Data Compression: Use efficient data formats like Parquet or ORC to reduce storage costs and improve query speed.
• Lifecycle Policies: Implement lifecycle policies to transition older data to cheaper storage tiers.
• Data Governance: Ensure proper access controls and data quality checks are in place.

Data Lake vs. Data Warehouse
Data Lake:
• Stores raw data in its native format.
• Handles a variety of data types and formats.
• Suitable for large-scale data analytics.

Data Warehouse:
• Stores structured, processed data.
• Optimized for fast query performance.
• Suitable for reporting and business intelligence.

Data Lake Design in Layers
Layered Architecture for Cost-Performance:
• Landing Zone: Raw data is ingested here.
• Cleansed Zone (Single Source of Truth, SSOT): Data is cleaned and validated.
• Reporting Zone: Data is optimized for query performance and used by BI tools.
• WORM Model (Write Once, Read Many):
Data is written once and read multiple times, ensuring immutability and data integrity.

AWS Data Catalog
Centralized Metadata Repository:
• Maintains metadata for data stored in the data lake.
• Supports data discovery, schema evolution, and governance.

ETL in AWS Glue Spark Jobs
Data Transformation and Loading:
• AWS Glue Spark jobs handle ETL processes.
• Transform data using Spark within Glue jobs.
• Integrate with Amazon SageMaker for advanced analytics using Jupyter Notebooks.

Amazon SNS for Alerting
Notification Service:
• Send alerts and notifications for data processing events.
• Integrate with other AWS services for monitoring and alerting.

SQL using Amazon Athena and Spark SQL
Query Optimized Data Layers:
• Use Amazon Athena for serverless SQL queries on S3 data.
• Use Spark SQL for complex transformations within AWS Glue.
• Optimized data layers improve query performance and reduce costs.

Ingest Changes Incrementally and Schema Evolution
Handling Incremental Data and Schema Changes:
• Implement incremental data ingestion to keep the data lake updated.
• Support schema evolution to handle changes in data structure without disrupting processing.

BI Dashboards in Amazon QuickSight
Business Intelligence and Visualization:
• Use Amazon QuickSight to create interactive dashboards.
• Connect to the data lake for real-time insights and reporting.
